# OOT
This was my Object Orientended Techniques Assignment, for this we had to use a hash-table to sort and keep track of particles as they move around the screen. we had to the hash-table to split up collision detection and make the program run smooth, i was able to run smooth with about 60,000 particles on my screen.
